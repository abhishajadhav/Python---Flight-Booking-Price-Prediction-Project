# Python---Flight-Booking-Price-Prediction-Project

Analyze the flight booking dataset to predict ticket prices based on various features like airline, source/destination cities, flight duration, and more. The project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and machine learning algorithms to extract valuable insights.

Dataset:
The dataset contains records with 11 attributes related to flight bookings.

Attributes:
Airline: Name of the airline.
Flight: Plane’s flight code.
Source City: Departure city.
Departure Time: Time when the flight departs.
Stops: Number of stops between source and destination cities.
Arrival Time: Time of flight arrival.
Destination City: Arrival city.
Class: Seat class.
Duration: Travel time between cities in hours.
Days Left: Difference between booking date and trip date.
Price: Ticket price (target variable).

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning and handling missing values.
One-hot encoding for categorical features.

Data Visualization:
Line chart, column chart, and heatmaps to visualize trends and correlations.
Machine Learning Models:

Applied Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluated models using R² Score, MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
